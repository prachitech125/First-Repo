This project demonstrates the use of Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) to create a simple GUI application with CheckboxGroup functionality.
It allows users to select one game at a time — Cricket, Football, or Hockey — and displays the selected option dynamically on the window.

Features

Graphical User Interface built using Java AWT

Radio-style checkboxes (mutually exclusive selection)

Real-time label updates based on user selection

Graceful window close handling using WindowAdapter
